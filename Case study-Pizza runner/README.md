## Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 6 key datasets for this case study:

### **```runners```**

The runners table shows the **```registration_date```** for each new runner.

Customer pizza orders are captured in the **```customer_orders```** table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.

### **```runner_orders```**

View table
</summary>

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

  ru.runner_id,
  DATE_PART('minute', AVG(ru.pickup_time::timestamp - co.order_time)) AS avg_arrival_minutes
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN customer_orders AS co 
 ON co.order_id = ru.order_id
WHERE ru.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY ru.runner_id;
```
| runner_id | avg_arrival_minutes |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | 15                  |
| 2         | 23                  |
| 3         | 10                  |

### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
```SQL
SELECT
  ru.order_id,
  count(co.pizza_id) AS pizzas_count,
  ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ru.pickup_time::TIMESTAMP - co.order_time))::DECIMAL/60, 2) AS avg_time,
  CASE  WHEN COUNT(co.pizza_id) = 1 THEN 'Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare'
	WHEN COUNT(co.pizza_id) > 1 THEN 'Preparation time is based on order quantity, approximately or more than 10 minutes per order' END AS relationship
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN customer_orders AS co
  ON co.order_id = ru.order_id 
WHERE ru.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ru.order_id, ru.pickup_time, co.order_time
ORDER BY ru.order_id;
```

|order_id| pizzas_count | avg_time |			relationship		                |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
|  1	 |	1	        |   10.53  |	Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare	    |
|  2	 |	1	        |   10.03  |	Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare	    |
|  3	 |	2	        |   21.23  |	Preparation time is based on order quantity |
|  4	 |	3	        |   29.28  |	Preparation time is based on order quantity |
|  5	 |	1	        |   10.47  |	Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare	    |
|  7	 |	1	        |   10.27  |	Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare	    |
|  8	 |	1	        |   20.48  |	Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare	    |
|  10	 |	2	        |   15.52  |	Preparation time is based on order quantity |

### **Q4. What was the average distance travelled for each runner?**
```SQL
SELECT  runner_id,
	ROUND(AVG(distance::DECIMAL), 2) AS avg_distance
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

| runner_id | avg_distance |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1         | 15.85        |
| 2         | 23.93        |
| 3         | 10.00        |

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
SELECT MAX(duration::INT) - MIN(duration::INT) AS difference
FROM runner_orders;
```

| difference |
|------------|
| 30         |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
SELECT
  ru.order_id,
  ru.runner_id,
  COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS pizza_count,
  ROUND(AVG(distance::DECIMAL), 1) AS distance,
  ROUND(AVG(duration::INT), 1) AS duration,
  ROUND(AVG(ru.distance::DECIMAL/ru.duration::INT)*60, 2) AS speed_kmh
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN customer_orders AS co
  ON ru.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE ru.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY ru.order_id, ru.runner_id
ORDER BY speed_kmh DESC;
```

| order_id | runner_id | pizzas_count | distance | duration | speed_kmh |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 8        | 2         | 1            | 23.4     | 15       | 93.60 	|
| 7        | 2         | 1            | 25       | 25       | 60.00 	|
| 10       | 1         | 2            | 10       | 10       | 60.00 	|
| 2        | 1         | 1            | 20       | 27       | 44.44 	|
| 3        | 1         | 2            | 13.4     | 20       | 40.20 	|
| 5        | 3         | 1            | 10       | 15       | 40.00 	|
| 1        | 1         | 1            | 20       | 32       | 37.50 	|
| 4        | 2         | 3            | 23.4     | 40       | 35.10 	|

**Finding:**
- **Orders are listed in decreasing order of average speed:**
> *Although the fastest order delivered only 1 pizza and the slowest order delivered 3 pizzas, there is no clear trend indicating that more pizzas in an order result in slower delivery speeds.*


### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
SELECT
  ru.runner_id,
  ROUND(100.0*cte.successful_order/COUNT(ru.order_id)) AS delivery_percent
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN (
    SELECT
	runner_id,
	COUNT(order_id) AS successful_order
    FROM runner_orders
    WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY runner_id) AS cte
 ON cte.runner_id = ru.runner_id
GROUP BY ru.runner_id, cte.successful_order
ORDER BY ru.runner_id;
```

| runner_id | delivery_percent |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 100              |
| 2         | 75               |
| 3         | 50               |
