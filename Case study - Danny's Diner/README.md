## 🛠Problem Statement

>Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
>
>He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **```sales```**
<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The sales table captures all **```customer_id```** level purchases with an corresponding **```order_date```** and **```product_id```** information for when and what menu items were ordered.

| customer_id | order_date | product_id |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | 1          |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | 2          |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | 2          |
| A           | 2021-01-10 | 3          |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | 3          |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | 3          |
| B           | 2021-01-01 | 2          |

| B           | 2021-01-16 | 3          |
| B           | 2021-02-01 | 3          |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | 3          |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | 3          |
| C           | 2021-01-07 | 3          |

</details>


### **```menu```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The menu table maps the **```product_id```** to the actual **```product_name```** and **```price```** of each menu item.

| product_id | product_name | price |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
| 1          | sushi        | 10    |
| 2          | curry        | 15    |
| 3          | ramen        | 12    |

</details>

### **```members```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The final members table captures the **```join_date```** when a **```customer_id```** joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.


| customer_id | join_date  |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 2021-01-07 |
| B           | 2021-01-09 |

```SQL

    	SUM(CASE WHEN order_date >= join_date AND order_date < join_date + INTERVAL '1 week' THEN price*20 
            WHEN (order_date >= join_date + INTERVAL '1 week' OR order_date < join_date) AND menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN price*20 
            ELSE price*10 END) AS total_point
    FROM sales
    JOIN menu
    ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id

| customer_id | total_point |
| ----------- | ----------- |
