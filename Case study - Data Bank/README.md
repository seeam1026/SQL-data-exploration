## 🛠Problem Statement

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world…so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

### **Q1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?**
```SQL
    SELECT txn_type, COUNT(*) AS total_count, SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amount
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
    GROUP BY txn_type
    ORDER BY total_amount;
```

>Output

| txn_type   | total_count | total_amount |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| withdrawal | 1580        | 793003       |
| purchase   | 1617        | 806537       |
| deposit    | 2671        | 1359168      |

*The query reveals that deposit transactions have the highest total count (2671) and total amount (1,359,168), followed by purchase and withdrawal transactions, indicating that deposit transactions constitute the majority of customer activities.*

### **Q2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?**
```SQL
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(deposit_count), 2) AS avg_deposit_count,
    ROUND(AVG(sum_amount), 2) AS avg_amount
    FROM (
      SELECT customer_id, COUNT(txn_type) AS deposit_count, SUM(txn_amount) AS sum_amount
      FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
      WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
      GROUP BY customer_id) AS cte_customer_avg_amount;
```
>Output

| avg_deposit_count | avg_amount |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| 5.34              | 2718.34    |

*The query shows that, on average, customers have made approximately 5.34 deposits, with an average total amount of 2,718.34 per customer.*
### **Q3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?**
```SQL
    WITH activity_count AS (
    SELECT 
      customer_id, 
      DATE_PART('month', txn_date) AS txn_month, 
      TO_CHAR(txn_date, 'month') AS month_name, 
      SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_deposit_monthly, 
      SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_withdrawal_monthly, 
      SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_purchase_monthly
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id, txn_month, month_name)
    
    SELECT month_name, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
    FROM activity_count
    WHERE total_deposit_monthly > 1 AND (total_withdrawal_monthly >= 1 OR total_purchase_monthly >= 1)
    GROUP BY txn_month, month_name
    ORDER BY txn_month;
```
>Output

| month_name | customer_count |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| january    | 168            |
| february   | 181            |
| march      | 192            |
| april      | 70             |

*The query shows the number of customers making more than 1 deposit along with either 1 withdrawal or 1 purchase varies. There is a noticeable decline in the customer count from March to April, suggesting a decrease in such activity.*
### **Q4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?**
**Steps**

* CTE_balance:
Selects customer_id, txn_month, and calculates balance_amount based on transaction type.
Deposits increase the balance, while withdrawals and purchases decrease it.
Groups by customer_id and txn_month.

* SELECT:
Calculates the cumulative ending_balance for each customer by summing balance_amount across all previous months, partitioned by customer_id.
Uses the window function SUM(balance_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) to achieve this.

```SQL
    WITH CTE_balance AS (
    SELECT 
      customer_id, 
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS txn_month,
      SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
          WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN -txn_amount 
          ELSE 0 END) AS balance_amount
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id, txn_month)
    
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      txn_month,
      SUM(balance_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) AS ending_balance
    FROM CTE_balance;
```

### **Q5. What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?**
**Steps**

* The goal is to calculate the percentage of customers whose closing balance increases by more than 5% between consecutive months.

* Use generate_series to create a continuous list of monthly dates for each customer. This ensures we have a row for every month, even if there are no transactions in that month.

* For each monthly date, calculate the closing_balance using deposits and withdrawals/purchases.

* Compute cumulative balances using the SUM window function. This represents the balance from the start of all previous months.

* Use the LEAD function to get the next month's balance for comparison

* Calculate the percentage increase between the current month’s balance and the next month’s balance.

* Finally, calculate the percentage of customers with a balance increase of more than 5%.

```SQL
    WITH all_month AS (
      SELECT customer_id, 
      	generate_series(DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(txn_date)), DATE_TRUNC('month', MAX(txn_date)), '1 month')::DATE AS txn_month

		Data Allocation Challenge
	</summary>
	
### To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

**Option 1:** data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month

**Option 2:** data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days

**Option 3:** data is updated real-time

For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

* running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction

* customer balance at the end of each month

* minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

---
>**OPTION 1**

**The Objective:**
Calculate the end-of-month balances for each customer based on their transactions.
Sum these balances across all customers for each month to estimate the total data allocation requirements.

**Steps in query:**
* **Step 1: Prepare a Running Balance for Each Month:**

Use a CASE statement to calculate the net transaction amount for each customer during a specific month:
Add amounts for deposits.
Subtract amounts for withdrawals or purchases.
Use GROUP BY on customer_id and txn_month to aggregate monthly running balances.

* **Step 2: Calculate End-of-Month Balances:**

Use a window function (SUM with OVER) to calculate the cumulative balance for each customer up to the end of each month.
Partition the calculation by customer_id and order it by txn_month

```SQL
    WITH cte_running_balance AS (
          SELECT 
          	customer_id, 
          	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS txn_month, 
          	SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
                WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN -txn_amount 
                ELSE 0 END) AS running_balance_monthly
          FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
          GROUP BY customer_id, txn_month
          ORDER BY customer_id)
          
          SELECT 
          	customer_id, 
          	txn_month, 
          	running_balance_monthly, 
          	SUM(running_balance_monthly) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_month) AS end_running_balance
          FROM cte_running_balance;
        
```
*Sample output:*

| customer_id | txn_month | running_balance_monthly | end_running_balance |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | 1         | 312                     | 312                 |
| 1           | 3         | -952                    | -640                |

* **Step 3: Aggregate Total Monthly Balances:**

Sum the end_running_balance across all customers for each month.
Group the results by txn_month and order them to display balances chronologically.

***Insights:***

The first month (January) shows a positive cumulative end balance of 126,091, indicating a net deposit-heavy behavior among customers.
This could reflect customers' tendency to deposit or maintain higher balances early in the year.
Negative Balances in Subsequent Months:

Starting from February, the cumulative end balances drop into negative territory, reaching a low of -194,916 in March. This suggests an overall withdrawal or expenditure trend outweighing deposits.
Slight Recovery in April:

In April, there’s a slight improvement (-180,855) compared to March, which may indicate a stabilization or reduction in withdrawal/purchase activity.

**Behavioral Patterns:**
Customers may exhibit a "deposit early, spend later" pattern, with withdrawals and purchases dominating after January.

**-> Resource Allocation:**

* January:
The cumulative balance is positive (126,091), so data needs to be allocated for this positive balance. This reflects a month where deposits outweigh withdrawals or purchases.

* February:
The cumulative balance turns negative (-34,350), which means more withdrawals or purchases were made than deposits. Therefore, data allocation should also account for this negative balance as it represents accounts with a deficit.

* March:
The cumulative balance is much lower at -194,916, showing a greater deficit compared to February. This indicates a higher level of withdrawals or purchases that require data management.

* April:
The cumulative balance slightly improves but remains negative at -180,855. This means that even though it’s an improvement from March, it still requires data to manage accounts with negative balances.

Insight for Data Allocation:
Even negative balances require data: While negative balances may seem to represent a reduced need for data, they still require allocation because managing deficits is critical for ensuring accurate tracking and customer account health.

>**OPTION 2**

**Steps in query:**

* **Step 1: Running Balance:**

Create a cumulative balance for each transaction by considering deposits as positive values and withdrawals/purchases as negative values. 
Use the CTE  to calculate the cumulative balance (end_running_balance) for each customer on each transaction date.

* **Step 2: 30-Day Rolling Average:**

Calculate the average balance over the past 30 days for each transaction date, ensuring data allocation considers short-term account activity.

```SQL
    WITH running_balance AS (SELECT customer_id, txn_date, txn_amount, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS txn_month,
    CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN txn_amount
    WHEN txn_type IN ('withdrawal', 'purchase') THEN -txn_amount ELSE 0 END AS running_balance
    FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
    ORDER BY customer_id, txn_date),
    
    daily_balance AS (
      SELECT customer_id, txn_date, txn_month, txn_amount, running_balance, SUM(running_balance) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date) AS end_running_balance
    FROM running_balance)
    
      SELECT customer_id, txn_date, txn_month, txn_amount, running_balance, end_running_balance,
    ROUND(AVG(end_running_balance) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY txn_date RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '30 DAYS' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)) AS avg_rolling_30days_running_balance
    FROM daily_balance;
```

| 4         | -361023                   |

***Insight:***

* January:
The cumulative average balance over the past 30 days is positive (548,719). This indicates that, on average, more deposits occurred compared to withdrawals and purchases.

* February:
The 30-day rolling average balance decreases to 311,818. While still positive, it reflects a decline in activity compared to January.

* March:
The balance turns negative (-564,995). This suggests that withdrawals and purchases significantly outweigh deposits, requiring more data allocation for accounts with deficits.

* April:
The cumulative average balance remains negative (-361,023). This shows persistent negative account balances, and thus higher data management is necessary to handle deficit scenarios.

| 4         | -486315               |

***Insight from Data***

* Month 1 shows the highest accumulation:

The large positive balance (392,122) suggests significant deposits or minimal spending, leading to lower storage demands compared to months with negative balances.

* Month 3 indicates the highest withdrawals/spending:

With a record negative balance (-888,338), this month requires the highest data storage capacity to capture frequent transactions in the negative range.

* Month 2 and Month 4 show more balanced trends:

Month 2: Although still positive, the sharp decline from Month 1 (to just 29,832) signals a transition phase.

Month 4: While the balance remains negative, it shows improvement from Month 3, suggesting a stabilization or slowdown in withdrawals/spending.

***Impact on Data Allocation***

* Higher storage allocation for Month 3:
This month demands the most storage due to frequent transactions leading to a record-high negative balance. Enhanced storage is critical for maintaining transaction continuity.

* Month 1 requires the least storage:
Positive cash flow and low volatility reduce the need for extensive data storage.

* Balanced allocation for Months 2 and 4:
  
Month 2: While positive, its transitional nature necessitates stable storage to handle fluctuations.

Month 4: Despite slight improvement from Month 3, it still requires considerable storage to record negative balance transactions.

***Conclusion***

Prioritize storage allocation as follows:
Month 3 > Month 4 > Month 2 > Month 1 (in descending order of storage demand).
