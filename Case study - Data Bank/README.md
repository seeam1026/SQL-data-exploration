## üõ†Problem Statement

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world‚Ä¶so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

Data Bank runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

  ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ru.pickup_time::TIMESTAMP - co.order_time))::DECIMAL/60, 2) AS avg_time,
  CASE  WHEN COUNT(co.pizza_id) = 1 THEN 'Takes more than 10 minutes to prepare'

```SQL
SELECT  runner_id,
	ROUND(AVG(distance::DECIMAL), 2) AS avg_distance
FROM runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id;
```

| runner_id | avg_distance |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1         | 15.85        |
| 2         | 23.93        |
| 3         | 10.00        |

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
SELECT MAX(duration::INT) - MIN(duration::INT) AS difference
FROM runner_orders;
```

| difference |
|------------|
| 30         |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
SELECT
  ru.order_id,
  ru.runner_id,
  COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS pizza_count,
  ROUND(AVG(distance::DECIMAL), 1) AS distance,
  ROUND(AVG(duration::INT), 1) AS duration,
  ROUND(AVG(ru.distance::DECIMAL/ru.duration::INT)*60, 2) AS speed_kmh
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN customer_orders AS co
  ON ru.order_id = co.order_id
WHERE ru.cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY ru.order_id, ru.runner_id
ORDER BY speed_kmh DESC;
```

| order_id | runner_id | pizzas_count | distance | duration | speed_kmh |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 8        | 2         | 1            | 23.4     | 15       | 93.60 	|
| 7        | 2         | 1            | 25       | 25       | 60.00 	|
| 10       | 1         | 2            | 10       | 10       | 60.00 	|
| 2        | 1         | 1            | 20       | 27       | 44.44 	|
| 3        | 1         | 2            | 13.4     | 20       | 40.20 	|
| 5        | 3         | 1            | 10       | 15       | 40.00 	|
| 1        | 1         | 1            | 20       | 32       | 37.50 	|
| 4        | 2         | 3            | 23.4     | 40       | 35.10 	|

**Finding:**
- **Orders are listed in decreasing order of average speed:**
> *Although the fastest order delivered only 1 pizza and the slowest order delivered 3 pizzas, there is no clear trend indicating that more pizzas in an order result in slower delivery speeds.*


### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
SELECT
  ru.runner_id,
  ROUND(100.0*cte.successful_order/COUNT(ru.order_id)) AS delivery_percent
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN (
    SELECT
	runner_id,
	COUNT(order_id) AS successful_order
    FROM runner_orders
    WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY runner_id) AS cte
 ON cte.runner_id = ru.runner_id
GROUP BY ru.runner_id, cte.successful_order
ORDER BY ru.runner_id;
```

| runner_id | delivery_percent |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 100              |
| 2         | 75               |
| 3         | 50               |
