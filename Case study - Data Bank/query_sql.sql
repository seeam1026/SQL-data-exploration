   Case Study Questions:
   Data Allocation Challenge
   --------------------*/

-- To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

-- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
-- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
-- Option 3: data is updated real-time
-- For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

-- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
-- customer balance at the end of each month
-- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer
-- Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?
