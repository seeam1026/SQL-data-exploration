# [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)

Welcome to my repository, where I share my solutions for the #8WeekSQLChallenge!

Here, you'll find in-depth answers to the 8 engaging case studies designed to hone SQL skills and problem-solving abilities. These challenges helped me deepen my understanding of SQL query writing, data analysis, and real-world data scenarios.

A big shoutout to Data with Danny for creating these incredible and inspiring SQL case studies! üéâ
