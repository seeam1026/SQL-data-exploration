## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 6 key datasets for this case study:

### **```runners```**
<details>

</summary>

The runners table shows the **```registration_date```** for each new runner.



|runner_id|registration_date|
|---------|-----------------|
|1        |1/1/2021         |
|2        |1/3/2021         |

Customer pizza orders are captured in the **```customer_orders```** table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.

### **```runner_orders```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

## Clean pizza_recipes data:

- The 'topping' column is comma-seperated, it will be hard to query so i will explode it

** ** 
    CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_pizza_recipes (
    	pizza_id INT,
    	topping_id TEXT

    INSERT INTO temp_pizza_recipes (pizza_id, topping_id)
