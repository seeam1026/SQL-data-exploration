## üõ†Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### **```runners```**

The runners table shows the **```registration_date```** for each new runner.


|runner_id|registration_date|

</details>


### **```customer_orders```**

Customer pizza orders are captured in the **```customer_orders```** table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.

### **```runner_orders```**

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
```SQL

```SQL

| 1         | 15.85        |
| 2         | 23.93        |
| 3         | 10.00        |

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
SELECT MAX(duration::INT) - MIN(duration::INT) AS difference
FROM runner_orders;
```

| difference |
|------------|
| 30         |

### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
SELECT

  ROUND(AVG(distance::DECIMAL), 1) AS distance,
  ROUND(AVG(duration::INT), 1) AS duration,

**Finding:**
- **Orders are listed in decreasing order of average speed:**
> *Although the fastest order delivered only 1 pizza and the slowest order delivered 3 pizzas, there is no clear trend indicating that more pizzas in an order result in slower delivery speeds.*


### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
SELECT

  ROUND(100.0*cte.successful_order/COUNT(ru.order_id)) AS delivery_percent
FROM runner_orders AS ru
JOIN (
    SELECT
	runner_id,

    GROUP BY runner_id) AS cte
 ON cte.runner_id = ru.runner_id
GROUP BY ru.runner_id, cte.successful_order
ORDER BY ru.runner_id;
```

| runner_id | delivery_percent |
|-----------|------------------|

### **Q4. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?**

```SQL
    WITH cte_money AS (
      SELECT co.order_id, ru.runner_id, CASE WHEN co.pizza_id = 1 THEN COUNT(pizza_id)*12 ELSE COUNT(pizza_id)*10 END AS total_money
      FROM customer_orders AS co
      JOIN runner_orders AS ru
      ON co.order_id = ru.order_id
      WHERE ru.pickup_time <> 'null'
      GROUP BY co.order_id, ru.runner_id, co.pizza_id
      ORDER BY co.order_id),
    
    cte_revenue AS ( 
      SELECT order_id, runner_id, SUM(total_money) AS total_revenue
      FROM cte_money
      GROUP BY order_id, runner_id),
    
    cte_cost AS (
      SELECT order_id, runner_id, round(0.3*distance::DECIMAL, 2) AS total_cost
      FROM runner_orders
      WHERE pickup_time <> 'null'
      GROUP BY order_id, runner_id, distance
      ORDER BY order_id)
    
    SELECT 
    	cte_revenue.order_id, 
        cte_revenue.runner_id, 
        cte_revenue.total_revenue, 
        cte_cost.total_cost, 
        cte_revenue.total_revenue - cte_cost.total_cost AS total_profit
    FROM cte_revenue
    JOIN cte_cost 
    ON cte_cost.order_id = cte_revenue.order_id;
```
